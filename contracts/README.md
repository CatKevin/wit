Sui Move package(s) and supporting scripts for repository state (`update_head`, ACL), Seal policy helpers, and deployment configs per network.

Structure:
- `move/` : Move packages (repository state, ACL). TBD: add package source and Move.toml.
- (future) `scripts/`: deploy/upgrade scripts per network, emit package IDs for CLI config.

Status: scaffolding only; modules to be added in Stage 3.
